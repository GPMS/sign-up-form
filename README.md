# Sign-up Form 

This is my implementation of the [Sign-up Form Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form)
from the JavaScript path of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

In this project we create and validate an HTML form, styling it to look like the given design.
